🚲 Dynamic Trip Predictor
📌 Overview

This project predicts bike trip durations using the Divvy bike-sharing dataset. Divvy is a bike-sharing company based in Chicago, and the dataset used here is the official open-source trip data published on their website.

I collected four quarters of trip data, merged them into a single dataset, and then performed:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends

Data cleaning to handle missing and inconsistent values

Outlier treatment using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method

Visualization to uncover insights about trip durations and user behavior

Linear Regression modeling, which achieved an accuracy of around 70% in predicting trip duration.

📊 Features

Comprehensive EDA with trend visualizations

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Outlier Detection using IQR

Linear Regression Model for prediction

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy for preprocessing)

Matplotlib for visualizations

Scikit-learn for regression modeling

Jupyter Notebook for implementation


✅ Results

Model Accuracy: ~70%

The analysis and visualizations provide insights into:

Peak trip times and durations

Seasonal/quarterly usage trends

How factors like user type and time of day affect trip length# Dynamic-Trip-Predictor
